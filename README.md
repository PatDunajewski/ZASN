Whole project was done by other people, however part of my project was to combine two architectures. One of them was BigBird and secound one was ALBERT. Main change was addition of the innovation from ALBERT into BigBird. Changes can be seen mainly in bigbird/core/encoder.py and bigbird/core/flags.py.
